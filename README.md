# IP_To_FQDN
This script can be used to identify the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to multiple IP addresses within a file.
Major Steps:
+ Enusre that DNSPython has been installed to your machine.
  - If you have Python installed, simply do "pip install dnspython".
+ Create a *.txt* file and save the IP addresses you want into it. 
  - Note: Each IP address should be on a separate line. The file should end on the last IP address. *If you open the file and the mouse       cursor appears on a newline under your last IP address, this will trigger an error.*
+ Ensure that the *.txt* file is saved within the same file path as ip_to_fqdn.py
